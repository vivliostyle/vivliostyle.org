We have released Vivliostyle version 2019.8.100.

(See the latest [Vivliostyle Viewer](https://vivliostyle.org/viewer/), and [User's Guide](https://vivliostyle.org/docs/user-guide/))

### Vivliostyle.js source code is now written in TypeScript

Vivliostyle.js started out as a fork of the [EPUB Adaptive Layout implementation](https://github.com/sorotokin/adaptive-layout) developed around 2013 by [Peter Sorotokin](https://twitter.com/sorotokin) at Google. The original code was written in JavaScript (ES5) with [type annotation for the Closure Compiler](https://github.com/google/closure-compiler/wiki/Annotating-JavaScript-for-the-Closure-Compiler), and Vivliostyle.js, whose main developer was [Toru Kawakubo](https://twitter.com/kwkbtr_t) now at Trim-marks Inc., continued being developed in the same way.

Since the ES5 JavaScript style is old and hard to maintain, we decided to migrate to TypeScript. This [migration to TypeScript has now been finished](https://github.com/vivliostyle/vivliostyle/tree/master/src/ts). [[#536]](https://github.com/vivliostyle/vivliostyle/pull/536)

We hope the new TypeScript code will encourage people to contribute to the open source Vivliostyle development.

For development, see the [Development document](https://github.com/vivliostyle/vivliostyle/wiki/Development).
