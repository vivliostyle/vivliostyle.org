## Introduction

In November 2024, we decided to apply for the “NGI0 Commons Fund,” a grant from the NLnet Foundation. The Foundation is a public benefit organization based in the Netherlands that supports organizations and individuals who contribute to achieving an open information society. After a review process of about half a year, we were very fortunate to receive an acceptance notice in June 2025.

## About the NLnet Foundation and the NGI0 Commons Fund

In 1982, EUnet (European Unix Network), Europe’s first communications network interconnecting networks in the Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden, and the United Kingdom, was established. The Dutch part of this network was called “NLnet.” Subsequently, the management of NLnet was taken over by the NLUUG (Netherlands UNIX User Group).

In 1989, NLUUG established the non-profit NLnet Foundation. Then in 1994, against the backdrop of the explosive growth of the internet, the Foundation established NLnet Holding BV, a commercial internet provider specializing in internet services and backbone provision, and the company grew steadily.

Later, in 1997, NLnet Holding BV merged with UUNET (a subsidiary of the US company WorldCom) and became independent of the Foundation. Since then, the Foundation has been actively working as a public benefit organization supporting the dissemination of open-source software and the privacy and security of internet users.

Meanwhile, the NGI0 Commons Fund is a grant program established as part of the European Commission’s [Next Generation Internet initiative](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/next-generation-internet-initiative). The fund’s objective is to support open-source technology projects that enhance the public nature, privacy, and security of the internet, and the Foundation is responsible for its administration and funding allocation.

We are deeply honored to receive a grant from the NGI0 Commons Fund, which is funded by the European Commission—the executive branch of the European Union (EU)—and administered by a foundation that has supported the internet and open source since their inception.

This has renewed our determination to contribute more than ever to internet standards and the open-source community. Please continue to follow and support Vivliostyle’s activities.
