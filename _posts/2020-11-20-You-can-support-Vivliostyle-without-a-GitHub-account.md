In April of this year, we began soliciting support from [GitHub sponsors<i class="mdi mdi-open-in-new"></i>](https://github.com/sponsors/vivliostyle). Fortunately, at the time of writing, [13 people](https://vivliostyle.org/sponsors/#sponsors-of-vivliostyle) have supported us from here. We are deeply grateful to our sponsors.

However, to further develop Vivliostyle, we need the support of many more people. GitHub Sponsors need to have a GitHub account. For engineers, GitHub is a familiar service, but for the rest of us, the vast majority of people don't even know it exists.

So, in order to help people who don't have a GitHub account to support Vivliostyle, we decided to use the [Robot Payment<i class="mdi mdi-open-in-new"></i>](https://www.robotpayment.co.jp/) credit card payment service.  You can now support Vivliostyle using their service at the following page.

GitHub sponsors only support recurring payments on a monthly basis. However, Robot Payment offers both recurring payments and one-time payments. The amount of support is also set to range from 100 yen to 250,000 yen for recurring payments and 100 yen to 600,000 yen for one-time payments. Also, while GitHub sponsors' payments are in dollars, Robot Payment is in yen.

Vivliostyle is an open source project. We hope that as many people as possible will support us in the way you prefer.
